//	Keyword
//	--------
//	A keyword is a predefined word whose meaning is already defined by the compiler.
//
//	In java all the keywords must be in lowercase only.
//
//	A keyword we can't use as a name of the variable, name of the class or name of the method.  
//
//	true, false and null look like keywords but actually they are literals.
//
//	As of now, we have 67 keywords in java.
