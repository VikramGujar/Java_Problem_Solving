	 What are valid statements for yield method?
	 => yield() 
	 	method when called on thread gives a hint to the thread scheduler that 
		the current thread is willing to yield its current use of  processor. 
		The thread scheduler is free to ignore this hint.

		yield() method stops thread for unpredictable time.
		
		yield() is a static method, hence calling Thread.yield() 
		causes currently executing thread to yield.
